This project explores real-world applications of Generative AI and multi-agent systems. It includes everything from RAG pipelines and AI travel planners to voice assistants and autonomous agents all built using Streamlit and LangChain.

The goal is to help developers and learners understand how large language models can be applied in practical ways, experiment with different architectures, and extend them to create their own intelligent applications.
